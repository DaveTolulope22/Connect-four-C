# Connect-four-C
As a part of my coursework in computer science, I developed a Connect Four game in C language using the concept of the minimax algorithm. The game is designed to be played by two players on the command-line interface, with the objective of getting four checkers in a row.
This project is a Connect Four game written in C. The game supports single-player (player vs. computer) and multi-player (player vs. player) modes. It includes the ability to undo and redo moves, save and load games, and keep track of high scores.
